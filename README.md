# Fuel Canary Watchtower

A tool to monitor both the Fuel and Ethereum chains and the bridge activities occurring between the two chains.

### Running

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-canary-watchtower
cd fuel-canary-watchtower
```

Copy the config file and remove the `.example` part, now edit the `watchtower_config.json` file with the details as needed.

If you require alerting you must set your [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) key as such in your terminal:

```sh
export PAGERDUTY_KEY_ENV_VAR=KEY-HERE
```

If you require automated pausing of contracts you must set your ethereum private key as such:

```sh
export PRIVATE_KEY_ENV_VAR=KEY-HERE
```

Build the project and run it:
```sh
cargo build
cargo run
```

### Config File

An example config file can be found at [watchtower_config.json.example](./watchtower_config.json.example). You can configure alerts by alert level and by action here is an example portal deposit alert:
```json
"portal_deposit_alerts": [
    {
    "alert_action": "PausePortal",
    "alert_level": "Info",
    "time_frame": 300,
    "token_name": "ETH",
    "token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "token_decimals": 18,
    "amount": 250
  }
]
```

In the above configuration is the ETH base asset has exceed the threshold of `250ETH` being deposited over a period of 300 seconds an alert of type INFO is sent and the Portal contract will be paused.

### ABI

The abi is generated from compiling the [fuel-bridge contracts](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-bridge)

### Alerts Module
The alerts module is responsible for pushing alerts through to some monitoring service as well as logging data to a log file. Logging is configured in [logging_config.yaml](./logging_config.yaml).

### Might Want to Add
- We currently only check that committed blocks match what's in the fuel chain. This does not protect us from a bug in the client that might screw up MessageOut receipts and allow for more ETH or tokens to be withdrawn than should be. We might want a setup that keeps a running log of all asset balances that have been approved for withdrawal and then trigger a pause if more are somehow withdrawn than expected. This would require some kind of persistent data store to work efficiently (like the current "alert" concept but with a timing window that spans from the start of the chain to now).
